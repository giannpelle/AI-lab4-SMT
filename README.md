# AIMA 2020 Assignment 4 - Minesweeper

This repository contains the group work submitted for the Assignment 4 of the [AIMA 2020](https://ole.unibz.it/course/view.php?id=6841) course from the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano.

## Problem description

The problem introduced by the assignment is to solve the Minesweeper game using a SAT solver.
The program takes in input a json with the current game setup (number of mines, map size, string matrix-like world configuration) and prints out all the *certain* information it can infer: it will modify the input values putting an "X" to indicate the presence of a mine, and a "s" to indicate that the cell is safe and can be explored. 

An example of the input to pass in is shown below:

??20001???  
??20012???  
?31001????  
?100012???  
?111001221  
???1000000  

resulting in the following output:

?X20001???  
XX20012???  
X31001Xs??  
s100012XXs  
s111001221  
ssX1000000

## Solution outputs

If you want to see the results (outputs) we got from running the minesweeper solver 
You can have a look at the results (outputs) we got from the [minesweeper]() game and all other [SMT exercises]() clicking on the links.

## Technical description

The assignment requires the use of the Z3 theorem prover from Microsoft Research, which is a cross-platform satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver.
We wrote down a set of assertions which have to be satisfied from every model generated by the solver. We then took ALL the models returned by the solver for a specific map configuration and made kind of an intersection of all models to get all the certain information we can infer for that input.   
We started simple by handwriting the smt model with all the necessary assertions, and then we automated the process developing a python script. 

## Running requirements

To run the code you have to create an *anaconda* environment with the configuration file found in *environment.yml* and then activate it to run the code.  
The required commands to make it work are the following:
1. `conda create env -f environment.yml`
2. `conda activate aima_smt`
3. `jupyter lab`

To run the sample code you just need to run the code cells in the files *SMT.ipynb*.
